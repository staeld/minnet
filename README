2 REQUIREMENTS

Minnet requires Lua 5.1, and the packages 'irc' (irc-lua), 'socket' 
(lua-socket), and 'lsqlite3' (lua-sqlite3). lsqlite3 requires a working sqlite 
library to be installed. 

Minnet should be cross-platform, given all of the requirements are sanely 
built and have taken into account that not all computers are POSIX compliant. 


2.1 NOTE

To use Minnet, you will need to patch your lua irc module with the file 
in this repo (asyncoperations.lua.patch). This is some strange design flaw in 
the module, and should not be necessary, but I'm lazy and apparently, the 
author of this module is, too.


3 Installation

Minnet is purely written in Lua, and as such does not need compiling. You can 
either place all the files as they are in a folder (like ~/bin/minnet), and 
run Minnet thence, or you can copy the required files (./minnet/*lua), 
including the directory they reside in, to the place where you have your 
global lua libraries (typically /usr/share/lua/5.1/).

For the required modules, please refer to the documentation of your OS. In 
Arch Linux, all packages are available through the standard repositories, plus 
the AUR (as of 2010-11-26).
