2 REQUIREMENTS

Minnet requires Lua 5.1, and the packages 'irc' (irc-lua), 'socket' 
(lua-socket), 'lsqlite3' (lua-sqlite3), 'ssl' (luasec) and 'crypto' 
(lua-crypto). lsqlite3 requires a working sqlite library to be installed, 
crypto and luasec require openssl. Luasec is optional, and only required if 
you want to make ssl-encrypted connections. 

Minnet as of currently has only been tested on GNU/Linux, but depending on how 
other systems handle certain things, it could work with little or no changes 
made to the programme. Implementing support for BSD and OS X should be a matter
of adding a few lines of code (provided the libraries required by Minnet work 
properly on the platforms).


2.1 NOTE

To use Minnet, you will need to patch your lua irc module with the file 
in this repo (asyncoperations.lua.patch). This is some strange design flaw in 
the module. It should not be necessary, but I'm lazy, and apparently, so is  
the author of the module.


3 INSTALLATION

Minnet is purely written in Lua, and as such does not need compiling. You can 
either place all the files as they are in a folder (like ~/bin/minnet), and 
run Minnet thence, or you can copy the required files (./minnet/*lua), 
including the directory they reside in, to the place where you have your 
global lua libraries (typically /usr/share/lua/5.1/).

To get the code, you can clone the git repo, which is located at 
<https://github.com/staeld/minnet.git>. This repo, even its master branch, is 
under heavy development, and there are no guarantees that the code will at any 
given time be stable or usable. Code in the master branch should generally not 
contain too many fatal bugs or inconsistencies, but it might have some. If you 
find anything and would like it fixed, feel free to notify me, preferably with 
a patch on your hand.

As of currently, Minnet looks for the libraries it needs (including its own 
configuration and function files) through the standard Lua paths library paths 
as queried by require(). This means that if you do not copy the files to some- 
where where Lua looks for them, you will need to run Minnet from its own 
directory (eg. `cd ~/bin/minnet/ && ./minnet.lua --run').

For installing the required modules, please refer to the documentation of your 
OS. In Arch Linux, all packages are available through the standard repositories
plus the AUR (as of 2010-11-26).
