Readme for minnet

This should hold some information about the project, what it can do and how to 
make it do so.

NOTE: To use Minnet, you will need to patch your lua irc module with the file 
in this repo (asyncoperations.lua.patch). This is some strange design flaw in 
the module, and should not be necessary, but I'm lazy and apparently, the 
author of this module is, too.
