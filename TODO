Todo atm:
    ! Move more of the commands block into a separate file and simply use
      commands[] for triggering these
    ! Add !-commands below

    ! Check if the WHERE nick OR cur_nick sql might be abused by nickchanging
    Add USERINFO, CLIENTINFO, FINGER, etc
    
    ! Check vulnerabilities for more than one user with the same nick
    
    
    Make her parse for words in the whole message rather than command keywords
        -Use several hooks, but keep wit() for simple commands that should stay
        -Or just remodel wit() to accomodate this?

Command ideas:
    ! Disabling function
    ! Flood protection - warn then kick (then ban?)

    ? JOTI functionality

    Statistics:     Sys details, resource usage, uptime (add weeks to uptime)
    Calculations:   Time calculations (how long from now to ${date}) [requires
                      thorough month handling and liberal date reading]
                    Calculator functionality
    Weather
    Maps:           "where is <place>?"; "show [me where] <place> [is]"
    Twitter:        Show last tweet(s) from <user>
    YouTube, etc:   Report what is in a given link
    (Last|Libre).fm Say what people are listening to
    Google/Wiki/etc Look up stuff
    

Wishlist:
    Provide documentation of what the hell the bloody commands actually do
    D&D functions and database?
    AI :D

Known bugs:
    quitting always results in a crash - this is irc.lua's fault. WONTFIX
