TODO file for Minnet

Roadmap:
    0.0.1
        Connects with set userinfo to table-defined servers and channels
    0.0.5
        Initial command reception code
    0.1.0
        Help command
        Quit command is protected (user recognition)
        Takes commands in channels and /msg
        Configuration in separate file
        Commands take arguments
    0.2.0
        Has a useful TODO and README
        Has commands for part, say, etc
    0.3.0
        Uses a working SQL user database system
    0.3.5
        Has UDB functions like OTL in the case of an empty database
    0.4.0
        Has liberal recognition of commands (hooks that look for keywords)
        Has multiple possible commands per action ("(what|how long) uptime")

Todo atm:
    Redesign some of the commands - do we need passwords?
    Provide documentation of what the bloody commands actually do
    Implement prepared SQL statements for secure lookups
    Add statistics commands (system details, resource usage, ...)
    
    Make her parse for words in the whole message rather than command keywords
        -Use several hooks, but keep wit() for simple commands that should stay

Wishlist:
    SSL
    AI :D
