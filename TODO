TODO file for Minnet

Todo atm:
    Self-status check (if isop())
        Set topic (access: oper)

    THINK: Is it better to let the config decide what fields can be set in the
        info database, or should people be allowed to set virtually any field?
    
    Per-command disabling (disable certain functions for a channel or net)
    User unignoring, listing ignores
    Add CTCP USERINFO, CLIENTINFO, FINGER, etc

    Check if the WHERE nick OR cur_nick sql might be abused by nickchanging
    Check vulnerabilities for more than one user with the same nick

Command ideas:
    Flood protection - warn then kick (then ban?); check for own op status

    ? JOTI functionality

    Statistics:     Sys details, resource usage, uptime (add weeks to uptime)
    Calculations:   Time calculations (how long from now to ${date}) [requires
                      thorough month handling and liberal date reading]
                    Calculator functionality
    Weather
    Maps:           "where is <place>?"; "show [me where] <place> [is]"
    Twitter:        Show last tweet(s) from <user>
    YouTube, etc:   Report what is in a given link
    (Last|Libre).fm Say what people are listening to
    Google/Wiki/etc Look up stuff

Wishlist:
    Provide documentation of what the hell the bloody commands actually do
    D&D functions and database?
    AI :D

Known bugs:
    Quitting always results in a crash - this is irc.lua's fault. WONTFIX
