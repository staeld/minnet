Todo atm:
    ! Implement prepared SQL statements for secure lookups

    Provide documentation of what the bloody commands actually do
    Add statistics commands (system details, resource usage, ...)
        -Add weeks to uptime stats
    
    Make her parse for words in the whole message rather than command keywords
        -Use several hooks, but keep wit() for simple commands that should stay
        -Or just remodel wit() to accomodate this?

Wishlist:
    D&D functions and database?
    SSL
    AI :D

Known bugs:
    quitting always results in a crash - this is irc.lua's fault. WONTFIX
