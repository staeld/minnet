TODO file for Minnet

Todo atm:
    [ ] Auto-leave empty channels

    [ ] Personal RSS tracker/reader (RSS via IRC)
    [/] Make test suite for config validation, and call at startup/config load
        Pretty much done; needs testing
    
    [x] NickServ integration: identify to services if present and configured
    [x] Command for (re-)identifying with NickServ
    [x] Commands to list RSS feeds and read last entry in a feed
    
    [/] Move command definitions to the relevant files for true modularity
    [ ] Split config.lua into config.lua and networks.lua
    [/] Todo list functionality in IDB


General stuff:
    Self-status check (if isop())
        Set topic
        Flood protection

    THINK: Is it better to let the config decide what fields can be set in the
        info database, or should people be allowed to set virtually any field?
        Solution: Use config to decide; setting it to '_ALL' or something alike
            means all fields allow; anything else restricts the fields.

    THINK: Should allowed fields in IDB be restricted per-channel, per-net or
        globally?

    Add CTCP USERINFO, CLIENTINFO, FINGER, etc. to CTCP replies

    THINK: Should ADMIN, OPER, USER levels be per-channel instead of global, in
        order to avoid unwanted privileges in differing channels?

    Check if the WHERE nick OR cur_nick sql might be abused by nickchanging
    Check vulnerabilities for more than one user with the same nick
    Consider using md5 hashes (or similar) for sql entries (nick, karma, etc.)


Command ideas:
    [ ] Watchdog for admin (notify on channel joins, etc.)

    New purpose: NickServ replacement on own network.
        Ideas:
            Set bot.isService in config to enable/disable
            If true, check for ircop access availability
            If ircop, ask server for user list; check if all are unknown or identified
            If unidentified user, warn then renick
            Use the current UDB, and extend its data/functionality
                Improve db design using keys (currently unnamed columns; possible security flaw)

    whatis unix command wrapper (combine with sql for a TLA/general database?)
    ping domain/ip       (availability)
    ping user's hostmask (latency)

    ? JOTI functionality

    Statistics:     Sys details, resource usage, uptime (add weeks to uptime)
    Calculations:   Time calculations (how long from now to ${date}) [requires
                      thorough month handling and liberal date reading]
                    Calculator functionality
                    Unit conversion (call `units'?)
    Weather
    Maps:           "where is <place>?"; "show [me where] <place> [is]"
    Twitter:        Show last tweet(s) from <user>
    YouTube, etc:   Report what is in a given link
    (Last|Libre).fm Say what people are listening to
    Google/Wiki/etc Look up stuff
    Bit.ly/etc      Link shortening and title resolution

Wishlist:
    D&D functions and database?
    AI :D

Known bugs:
    'db set' does not actually save anything to the udb.            FIXME
    database called after 'quit' closes it.                         FIXME

Known irc.lua bugs (these really should be fixed, but I don't maintain it):
    Quitting always results in a crash.                             WONTFIX
