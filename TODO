    1.0.0
        Uses ssl
        Has documentation
        Has a purpose
        Has no known bugs
        Causes a part of Hell to freeze over

Todo atm:
    ! Make allowed_level checking dynamically choose 1 level lower
        -Use same system as for verbosity (levels[l])?
    
    Make 'be' replace 'you' with 'she' and 'your' with 'her'
    Add connection port variable to config
    Provide documentation of what the bloody commands actually do
    Add statistics commands (system details, resource usage, ...)
        -Add weeks to uptime stats
    Make her parse for words in the whole message rather than command keywords
        -Use several hooks, but keep wit() for simple commands that should stay
        -Or just remodel wit() to accomodate this?

Wishlist:
    D&D functions and database?
    SSL
    AI :D

Known bugs:
    quitting always results in a crash - this is irc.lua's fault. WONTFIX
